we developed our innovate solution to block unsolicited and unwanted text  messages on mobile devices to prevent the user from receiving  annoying, irrelevant, or fraudulent text messages and protect their  personal information and privacy. For that we are using machine Learning and deploying for now in Streamlit and we finally dockerize it and deploy in our app using api and also we will perform osint analysis of our message and report it and analyse. Based on the message we will flag the message as ham and spam and ham message will be whitelisted and spam message will be blocked and further analysed using osint techniques and locate the ip address and analyse the link,file and phone number  of the spammer.
